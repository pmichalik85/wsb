### WSB repository
#### This repository will act as codebase for all programing exercises during my studies on 
[Wyższa Szkoła Biznesu - National Louis University](https://www.wsb-nlu.edu.pl/).
* ##### Main goal of having dedicated repository for studies is to keep track of my progress in expanding programing skills.
* ##### Secondary goal is to incorporate a habit of working with VCS.
* ##### Tertiary goal of this repository is to keep track of code changes via appropriate commits comments enabling myself tracking the changes, their reasons and self evaluate my progress due date.

Repository will by organized in a way that each of the folders will represent semester of studies.

In each of the semester folders i will create a folders for subjects related with wilting code.

Third level of folders will include particular exercises or group of exercises learned during lectures or as a part of assignments or projects.

Whole repository is wrapped into [Google Bazel](https://bazel.build/) project to ease code build, test and/or execution.
